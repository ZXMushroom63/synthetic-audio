Once the program has started, you can load projects using the 'Load' button. Supported formats are:
  -  .sm (SYNTHETIC music file)
  -  .mid (midi file, converted to .sm)

You can add nodes (tracks, loops, assets and filters) using the 'Add Tracks' menu in the top right, or using the Shift+A add menu.
  - Click to expand or shrink categories in the 'Add Tracks' menu
  - Press the ~Render Audio~ button to update the audio.


You can move tracks using the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.
  - Holding 'Ctrl' while doing this ignores the 'Substepping' option, and snaps to the nearest beat.
  - Holding 'Shift' ignores all snapping and moves directly to the mouse's location.

Dragging the handles on the left and right of nodes allows you to change it's duration.
  - 'Ctrl' and 'Shift' have the same effect
  - 'Alt' will resize the whole chord / node stack

You can right click on a node to edit its properties.

Nodes are applied in order from top to bottom.
For example, if you were to add an 'Advanced Synth' on top of a bitcrunch filter like this, only the end of the synth would be processed.

<br>

You can use different 'editor layers' for different components of a song. The current editor layer is controlled by the 'Editor Layer' input box in the bottom left of the editor.

Negative layers to not output any sound into the mixer, unless 'Isolate layer' is enabled. This makes them useful for experimenting, as well as creating procedural assets using the 'Save Asset' and 'Play Asset' nodes.

Layers are processed in order from the lowest to the highest. As such, a procedural asset defined on layer 7 may not work on layer 1.

`);

helpContent.addTab("Programmable Fields", `
If an input box in a node is purple, that means you can write inline scripts inside it.
Scripts are denoted with a ~#~ at the start of the input.

- For a simple linear interpolation, try inputting:   ~#0~24~
- For a exponential interpolation (squared), try inputting:   ~#0~24@2~
- For interpolating using a custom waveform, use ~#100~500@!custom_waveform_name~
  - You can cycle through the waveform at a frequency (eg: 2Hz) using ~#100~500@!custom_waveform_name!2~
  - You can cycle at a specified duration per cycle in seconds (eg: 4s) using ~#0~2@!wvform!4s~
  - You can cycle at a specified duration per cycle in beats (eg: every 1/2 beat) using ~#0~2@!wvform!0.5b~
- For writing arithmetic, do: ~#1*4~ (requires untrusted scripts enabled in settings, in the misc tab)

For writing an arbitrary script, do: ~#(()=>{/*/code/*/ return 1;})()~ (requires untrusted scripts enabled in settings, in the misc tab)
These scripts have access to the following variables:
- ~x~ - The percentage through the node
- ~rt~ - The total runtime of the node
- ~i~ - The index of the current sample

You can also bind programmable inputs to 'Automation Parameters', a type of node that lets you create and configure settings for synths and complex filter stacks.
Create an 'Automation Parameter' node, and name it. You can bind using:
- ~@MyParam~ - Directly binds the value
- ~@MyParam!0~5~ - Binds the value, and maps from 0-1 to the specified range

Much like Automation Parameters, the LFO engine has built-in support for per-chord randomisation, with this syntax:
- ~&RANDOMID~ (random between 0.0 and 1.0)
- ~&MYRAND!-2~5~ (random between -2.0 and 5.0)
- ~&anything!0~12~12~ (random between 0.0 and 12.0, spacing each random value out by 12. Effectively, randomly pick 0 or 12)
- ~&Name!-2~5@2~ (random between -2.0 and 5.0, exponent of 2)
- ~&&PerNote!0~1~ (random between 0.0 and 1.0 for each individual note in the chord)
Different random ids (part directly after ~&~)

In purple input boxes, you can also use autocomplete for notes.
- ~:a:~  =  ~:a4:~  =  ~440~
- ~:g#3:~  =  ~207~

In any input box, pressing...
- ~b~ will round the frequency into the nearest note.
- ~o~ will shift the frequency up 1 semitone,
- ~u~ will shift down 1 semitone.
- ~t~ will convert beats into seconds

In programmable input boxes, pressing...
- ~;~ will turn a frequency into a note representation ( ~440~ -> ~:a4:~ )
- ~'~ evaluates any inline script at 0% ( ~:a4:~ -> ~440~ , ~#0.5~1~ -> ~0.5~ )
`);
helpContent.addTab("Custom Waveforms",
  `
<img src="public/tutorial/wv.png" width=350><br>
This tab is where custom waveforms or LFOs are designed.

You can create waveforms using the ~New~ button.

- Waveforms in the project are listed on the left. You can click on on a waveform to start editing it.
- In the middle of the UI, there is a canvas for drawing waveforms.
  - The grey line is a constant midpoint where the value is equal to 0.
  - The orange line is the midpoint of the calculated waveform.
  - The cyan line is the raw data of the waveform.
  - The lime green line is the calculated data of the waveform, with all modifiers applied. If there are no modifiers, it overlaps the cyan line.
- Scrolling down past the canvas, there is a panel for interacting with the waveform.
  - Frequency & volume controls for previewing the waveform.
  - An image reference for cloning waveforms
  - Write from visualiser
    - Loads sample data from the visualiser
    - Smart - Loads data and searches for periodic samples, and loads those in.
    - Copy - Converts the waveform to text and stores it on your clipboard
    - Paste - Loads a waveform from your clipboard.
- On the right, you can add 'modifiers'
  - For example, a smooth modifier gets rid of sharp edges.

helpContent.addTab("Plugins", `
This tab is where external resources are managed. This includes:
 - Plugins that add nodes
 - Pure-data patches compiled with ~hvcc~
 - Soundfonts  
 - Arp Patterns
 - Sample Packs
 - Individual samples (usually inserted via drag-and-drop)
 - Extra tools in editor

The type of an installed plugin is indicated by the emoji on the filename's left.
 - ~[🇯‌🇸‌]~ indicates a generic plugin
 - ~[🎛️]~ indicates a pure-data patch
 - ~[🎸]~ indicates a soundfont
 - ~[🔊]~ or ~[🎞️]~ indicates a sample
 - ~[🔨]~ indicates a tool
 - ~[📦]~ indicates a samplepack


### Compiling and created patches with pure-data/plugdata
> Prerequisites: Install emsdk (https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)

Synthetic Audio supports using pure data/plugdata patches compiled with the heavy compiler collection (maintained by Wasted Audio, https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc).
Specifically, until further notice, you must use my fork which adds various features and fixes for the web compile target: https://github.com/ZXMushroom63/hvcc
Clone the repository, move into the \`hvcc/\` directory, and run \`pip3 install -e .\`

Make a patch (I recommend plugdata for the editor), and save it to a file. While creating your patch, I'd recommend enabling 'compiled mode' to disable features that are not supported by hvcc.
When you are done, go to the folder containing the patch, and run \`hvcc mypatch.pd -g js\`

Open SYNTHETIC's plugins tab, and press ~Upload hvcc (.js)~ . Go to the folder containing your patches, open the \`js/\` directory, and select BOTH .js files. SYNTHETIC will patch them to add offline support as well as editor integration. On reloading SYNTHETIC you will be able to find the patch available as a filter when using the ~Shift + A~ shortcut or in the Plugins category in the add menu.


Making different types of input:
SYNTHETIC offers an extension to the default ~@hv_param~ inputs. Providing a default value of ~440~ in a receive object will make the parameter apepar as ~:A4:~ in the editor.
~[r NoteInput @hv_param 0 1000 440]~
Note that receivers will all be updated at once, so try only triggering updates from one receiver.

You can also create dropdowns, that return the index of the selected element, using a double underscore ( ~__~ ) to seperate the name and options of the dropdown, and a single underscore ( ~_~ ) to seperate the options.
~[r MyDropdown__firstoption_secondoption_thirdoption @hv_param 0 2 0]~

You can load audio samples into by creating a table or an array with a ~@hv_table~ suffix. This will let users select any procedural audio assets from a dropdown.
~[table mysamples 100 @hv_table]~
When a table is filled, you can get it's size using ~[r tlen_mysamples @hv_param 0 99999999 0]~

As always, samplerate can be found using:\\
~[loadbang]~ \\
  ~|~ \\
~[samplerate]~

helpContent.addTab("Soundfonts", `
To use instruments such as piano, guitar, etc, you need to install Soundfonts in the plugins tab.
SYNTHETIC uses the MIDI.js soundfont format, as well as more recent and slightly unstable support for the standardised .sf2 format.

- In the plugins tab, SYNTHETIC by default has buttons to download the FluidR3-GM and MusyngKite soundfonts, converted to MIDI.js by [@gleitz on GitHub](http://github.com/gleitz).
- Once the soundfonts have finished downloading, restart the editor. 
- You can access the soundfonts in editor using an ~Instrument~ node.
- In the ~Instrument~'s options menu, you can select your desired instrument.

- For .sf2 soundfonts, upload them in the Plugins tab
- Once uploaded, restart the editor
- Then, add a SoundFont2 node in the timeline to access the soundfonts
`);
helpContent.addTab("Samplepacks", `
### Adding samplepacks
- Download a sample pack from your favourite website 
- In the Plugins tab, press ~Upload sample pack (.zip)~
- The samplepacks will load on the next start of the editor
- You can delete the copy of the samplepack that you downloaded, it is now stored on the editor.


### Using samplepacks
- After restarting the editor, you can view samplepacks by pressing ~Shift + S~
- If your samplepack does not appear, try closing and reopening the samplepack menu. Samplepacks are lazy-loaded to improve startup times.
- In the samplepack menu, click on your samplepack to open it.
- This will switch to the 'Tree View' at the top of the samplepacks menu.
- Click on your added sample to add it to the timeline. (click to pickup, click to drop)


### Importing samples
- To add samples, try drag-and-dropping a sample file into the timeline.
- You can access imported samples in the 'User' samplepack, or from the 'Samples' category in the 'Add Tracks' menu in the top right.
`);
helpContent.addTab("Live Mode", `
### Live Mode
If you are lucky enough to own an audio interface, SYNTHETIC instances hosted on websites can be used to process incoming signals through the 'Live' tab.
To start:
- Press 'Request Perms' to enable microphone/audio input permissions.
- In the dropdown, select the desired port of your audio interface
- In your operating systems audio mixer, choose your audio interface as the output device.
- Press 'Start Input'
- To stop, press 'Stop Input'

On the right side, some built-in filters like delay and a basic reverb are available.
On the left, you can use the filter module buttons to add filters to the stack column in the centre.
You can right click added modules to configure them.
Just remember to be careful to not accidentally destroy your ear drums.

Editor layer are ways to have different notes with different filters playing at the same type.
Layers 0-9 go into the volume mixer. They can be accessed using CTRL + 0, CTRL + 1, etc.
Layer 10 is a readonly layer where all loops are visible (for demos). It can be accessed with CTRL + SPACE
Negative layers can only be accessed using the number editor. Data does not go into the audio mixer, but assets are saved for future layers. It is primarily used for created loops/other assets that are used in layers 0-9.
